Just since I want to have a daily project, I am going to do some small beginner projects as well as some intermediate projects where I will learn new things and progress my coding skills.

This is a number guessing game that I want to add some formatting to so it looks nice in the terminal. I am also going to see if I can add other features and maybe some other small mini games that you can then choose to use like a terminal arcade. I just had that idea as I typed it and I think that sounds like a super cool idea. Maybe I could do a more fleshed out version of something like that in pygame once I learn it.

On top of this, I am going through the Python Crash Course book and freecodecamp.org. I also have Automate the Boring stuff (book) and peridocially do the free codecademy stuff. So I am 
always trying to find things that will help me get better at coding. I want to be fairly decent at python by the end of this year so I can start 2022 with some larger projects and be able
to learn other languages like Javascript and C. 

What are you doing to learn, push yourself, and get better every single day?
